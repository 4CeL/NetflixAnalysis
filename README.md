# NetflixAnalysis

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the Netflix content catalog, starting with the pre-processing of raw data using Python to ensure data cleanliness and consistency. Subsequently, the cleaned data is visualized using Tableau to uncover various insights, such as content growth trends, the distribution of dominant genres, and the global mapping of film and TV show production.
